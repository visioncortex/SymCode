## What is SymCode?
Short for Symbolic Code, SymCode is a 2D barcode that is designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable.

The symbol set here consists of 32 symbols which are composed of triangles, hence called Acute32.

## How does it work?
Long story short, we designed SymCode by following the artistic and scientific rules discovered from human languages.

SymCode also has standard barcode features, like finders, timers and error coding for machine readability.

## How to use it?

If you only want to integrate SymCode into your Javascript project, you can simply use the wasm 
binaries provided at [`acute32`](https://github.com/visioncortex/acute32).

## About Us
This project is a glimpse of the ongoing research and development by the Vision Cortex Research Group.

Focusing on semantic computer vision, our effort involve the analysis, representation and recognition of symbols and structures of artificial objects.
